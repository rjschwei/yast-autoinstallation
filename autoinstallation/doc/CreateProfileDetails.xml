    <title>Configuration and Installation Options</title>
    <para>
      This chapter introduces important parts of a control file for
      standard purposes. To have an idea about the other options available,
      use the configuration management system.     
    </para>
    <para>
      Note that for some of the configuration options to work, additional
      packages have to be installed, depending on the software selection you
      have configured. If you choose to install <emphasis>Minimal</emphasis>
      then some packages might be missing and those have to be added to the
      individual package selection.

      YaST will install packages required by YaST modules in the second phase
      of the installation and before the post-installation phase of AutoYaST
      has started, however if the YaST modules are not available in the
      system, this will not happen. For example, no security settings will be
      configured if <emphasis>yast2-security</emphasis> is not installed.

      <title>Keeping Specific Partitions</title>
      <para>
	In some cases you might choose to keep some partitions untouched

	co-exist with another operating system or if certain partitions
	contain data that you wish to keep untouched.
      </para>
      <para>
	Such scenarios require certain knowledge about the target systems
	and hard drives. Depending on the scenario, you might need to know
	the exact partition table of the target hard drive with partition
	id's, sizes and numbers. With such data you can tell &autoyast; to
	keep certain partitions, format others and create new partitions if 
	needed.
      </para>

      <title>New Feature</title>
    </note>
    <para>
      This option will allow the AutoYaST to use an existing
      <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> and use the partition data from
      from a previous installation. All partitions are kept and no new
      partitions are created. The found partitions will be formatted and
      mounted as specified in <filename>/etc/fstab</filename> found on a
      Linux root partition.
    </para>
    <para>
      Although the default behaviour is to format all partitions, it is
      also possible to leave some partitions untouched and only mount them,
      for example data partitions. If multiple installations are found on
      the system (multiple root partitions with different
      <emphasis>fstab</emphasis> files, the installation will abort, unless
      the desired root partition is configured in the control file. The

	You can install software on the new system using a pre-defined package base selection, i.e. Minimal, Minimal+X11,

      </para>
      <para>
	When installing from a CD-ROM, needed packages from other CD-ROMs
	are installed after the initial boot of the
	system in the second installation phase. If you
	are installing packages from multiple CD-ROMs, then
	auto-installation has to be interrupted for switching the
	CD-ROMs. In the case of NFS installation, all packages are
	installed at first stage of the installation only if the NFS repository
	is configured as a single medium.
      </para>
      <para>
	It is often required, that a package should be installed in the

      <title>
	Custom Package Selections
      </title>
      <para>	
	In addition to the pre-defined selections, you can create custom selections
	by providing  a selection file in the selection
	directory. (<filename>suse/setup/descr</filename>) The selection files have a special format and any
	additional selection file must conform to this format, otherwise
	&yast2; will not be able to read it.	  	  
      </para>
      <para>
	As an example for the selection file, take a look at the files

	the CD-ROMs.
      </para>
      <para>
	After creating a selection file, you can add it to the configuration

    <title>
      Installing additional and customized Packages
    </title>
    <para>
      In addition to the packages available for installation on the CD-ROMs,
      you can add external  packages including customized  kernels. Customized
      kernel packages must be compatible to the  &company-suse;  packages and must
      install the kernel files to the same locations.
    </para>
    <para>
      Unlike earlier versions, to install custom and external packages
      there is no need for a special resource in the control
      file. Instead you need to re-create the package database and update
      it with any new packages or new package versions in the source repository.
    </para>
    <para>
      A script is provided for this task which will query packages
      available in the repository and create the required package
      database.
    </para>    
      
    <para>
      Creating a new package database is only needed if new RPMs
      (i.e. update RPMs) were added. To re-create the database, use the
      <command>/usr/bin/create_package_descr</command>
      command. For example, use this command line to create the package
      database. (When creating the database, all languages will be reset to English).
    </para>
    <example>
      <title>Creating package database</title>
      <screen>
	cd /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse
	create_package_descr  -x PATH_TO_EXTRA_PROV -d /usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse 
      </screen>
    </example>
    <note>
      <title>Change starting from SUSE Linux 9.1/SLES 9</title>
      <para>To provide extra dependencies which can not be extracted from the
	rpm files, an extra file with missing dependencies is available in the
	directory <filename>suse/setup/descr</filename>. The file
	<filename>EXTRA_PROV</filename> can be used when recreating the package
	database using the <emphasis>-x</emphasis> option.</para>
    </note>
    <para>
      In the above example, the directory
      <filename>/usr/local/CDs/LATEST/suse</filename> contains the architecture
      dependent and independent packages, i.e. <emphasis>noarch</emphasis> and <emphasis>i586</emphasis>. 
      This might look different on other architectures.
    </para>
    <para>
      The advantage of this method is that you can keep an up-to-date
      repository with fixed and updated package (i.e. from &company-suse; FTP
      server). Additionally this method  makes the creation of custom CD-ROMs easier.
    </para>

  <section>
    <title>Kernel packages</title>
    <para>
      Kernel packages are not part of any selection. The required kernel
      is determined during installation. If the kernel package is added to any selection
      or to the individual package selection, installation will mostly fail due to conflicts.
    </para>
    <para>
      To force the installation of a specific kernel, use the
      <emphasis>kernel</emphasis> property. The following is an example
      forcing the installation of the default kernel. In this example this
      kernel will be installed in any case, even if an SMP or other kernel
      is required</para>

    <title>Removing automatically selected packages</title>
    <para>
      Some packages are selected automatically either because of a
      dependency or because it available in a selection.
    </para>
    <para>
      Removing such packages might break the system consistency and it is
      not recommended to remove basic packages unless a replacement which
      provides same services is provided. Best example for this case are
      <acronym>MTA</acronym> packages. By default, <emphasis>postfix</emphasis>
      will be selected and installed. If you wish however to use another
      <acronym>MTA</acronym> like <emphasis>sendmail</emphasis>, then
      postfix can be removed from the list of selected package using a list
      in the software resource. The following example shows how this can be done:

      Using the features of this module, you will be able to change the local
      security settings on the target system. The local security settings
      include the boot configuration, login settings, password settings,
      user addition settings, and file permissions.

      Configuring the security settings automatically corresponds to the
      <emphasis>Custom Settings</emphasis> in the security module available in
      the running system which lets you create your own, customized
      configuration.

    <title>Adding complete configurations</title>
    <para>
      For many applications and services you might have prepared a
      configuration file which should be copied in a complete form to some
      location in the installed system. This is for example if you are
      installing  a web server and have a <emphasis>ready to go</emphasis>
      server configuration file (<filename>httpd.conf</filename>).
    </para>
    <para>
      Using this resource, you can embed the file into the control file by
      specifying the final path on the installed system. &yast2; will copy this
      file to the specified location.
    </para>
    &example.files;

    <para>
      A more advanced example is shown below. This configuration will create
      a file using the content supplied in <emphasis>file_contents</emphasis>
      and will change the permissions and ownership of the file. After the
      file has been copied to the system, a script is executed which can be
      used to manipulate the file and prepare it for the environment of the client.

      hardware and system configuration which is available by default on
      any system installed manually and in an interactive way. For
      example, it is possible to configure printers, sound devices, TV
      cards and any other hardware components which have a module within YaST2.

	create such a configuration because of the complexity and the range
