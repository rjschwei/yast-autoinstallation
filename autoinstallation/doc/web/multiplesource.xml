    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      UnitedLinux defines a core set of packages which implement the UnitedLinux runtime environment.
      All tests, certifications, and applications are based on this set of packages
      which should not be altered in any way. The ideal way to guarantee
      unaltered data, is providing it on CD-ROM.
    </para>
    <para>
      However, this makes including (vendor specific) extensions and bug-fixes on
      the same media impossible. A separate media must be supplied for
      installation.
    </para>
    <para>
      The <emphasis>multiple source</emphasis> approach of YaST gives a solution as it allows
      installation from several (package) sources. So a customer can start
      installing from the original UnitedLinux CDs, proceed with a product CD,
      and end with a patch CD containing the latest security patches.
    </para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>
      The installer source
    </title>
    <para>
      When starting the installation from a media (CD, DVD, NFS, ...), linuxrc looks
      for a <filename>/boot/root</filename> file containing a complete
      (cramfs based) root filesystem for YaST.
    </para>

    <para>
      Usually, this file is on the boot CD, but other installation types are
      also supported by linuxrc. The information, where the <filename>/boot/root</filename> file
      came from, is passed to YaST and defines the installer source. 	
    </para>
    <para>	
      YaST now looks at this installer source for a <filename>/yast/order</filename> file. If this
      file exists, YaST goes into the <emphasis>multiple installation</emphasis> mode.
    </para>
    <para>
      In this mode, the source description (information about the packages) is on
      the installer source and the source data (the rpm packages itself) is
      on separate media.
    </para>
    <para>
      If the order file does not exist, YaST does not separate the source
      description from the source data and both must reside on the same
      media. (The latter is what happens if you boot the first UnitedLinux
      CD.)
    </para>

    <section>
      <title>File Structure on Installation CDs</title>
      <para>
	The following illustration shows the CD structure of the SLES CD.
      </para>
 
      <screen>
.

        `-- media.1

      </screen>

      <para>
	The media and product description is splitted to a set of files,
	separating the media preparation data from the contents (product) and
	making it possible to combine several products on a single media.
      </para>
      <para>
	At top-level of a media, a directory <filename>/media.1/</filename> should exists.
	If it does not exist, the presence of the correct media can not be
	verified. This may be convenient for an on-line media which just
	provides a set of packages.
      </para>
      <para>
	In this case, no verification takes place. The numeric extension depends
	on the media number in case of splitted medias. The first media has .1,
	the second .2, and so on.
      </para>
      <para>
	This allows merging all medias of a splitted set into a single
	directory. YaST always knows which media to expect and can thereby
	directly access the correct media directory.
      </para>
      <section>
	<title>Files inside boot/</title>
	<para>
	  the directory boot/ contains installation images and floppy images
	  that can be used to create boot and installation floppies. The
	  <filename>root</filename> files contains a complete
	  (cramfs based) root filesystem for YaST. This file contains the
	  actual installer. The <filename>root</filename> file is fetched by
	  <command>linuxrc</command> from the installation source and is
	  mounted in the installation environment. <command>Linuxrc</command>
	  starts the installer from within this file.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The directory <filename>boot/loader</filename> contains the kernel
	  and the initial ramdisk  used for installation. It also contains the
	  isolinux files used for creating the CD.
	</para>
      </section>
      <section>
	<title>Files inside media.N/</title>
	<para>
	  Inside the media.N/ directory the files media and products must
	  exist. Optionally, a file named patches may exist to denote a media
	  with patches (e.g. for YaST online update).
	</para>
     
	<itemizedlist>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The /media.N/media file</para>
	    <para>
	      The media file contains the media identifier needed to determine
	      correctness when using removable media.	
	      In case of splitted media, it must be present on every media of the
	      set.
	    </para>
	    <para>
	      This should contain a key to quickly identify correctness of the inserted
	      media. It is not shown to the user but should contain human-readable data
	      for debugging purposes.	      
	    </para>
	  </listitem>

	  <listitem>
	    <para>The products file</para>
	    <para>
	      The products file contains directory specifications for each product.
	      In case of splitted media, it must be present of the first media of the set.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The patches file</para>
	    <para>
	      The patches file contains a single directory specification for the root
	      of the patches directory tree.	
	      In case of splitted media, it must be present of the first media of the set.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	  <listitem>
	    <para>The info.txt file</para>
	    <para>
	      This file contains any licensing information that should be
	      presented to the user when YaST is started. If not present, no
	      license screen is shown. On the SLES CD, it contains the EULA.
	    </para>
	  </listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
       	
 
	<para>	
	  The identification data is stored inside the file on purpose. It could
	  also be encoded in the file name (older SuSE media did it). But this
	  requires a directory scan for file access and should be avoided.
	</para>
	<para>	By storing the vendor name in the file, the timestamp can be kept
	  vendor specific. (It's the name of the vendor who created the media
	  which might be different from a product vendor! It's just used as an
	  additional key for media identification.)
	</para>
	<para>
	  The media count is needed if the installation data is split up on
	  multiple (identical) medias. The media file on the first media should
	  contain the total count of medias.
	</para>
	<para>
	  The media count is a numerical value (all characters are digits).
	  It is an optional information on the other media.
	</para>
	<para>	
	  A forth line may contain flags further describing the media. n order to
	  distinguish the flags from the count line, the flags values start with
	  a letter.
	</para>
	<para>
	  All media of a media-set must have identical vendor and data
	  information in the media file.

	  on the media.

    <title>
      The order file
    </title>
    <para> 
      The order file defines which sources are needed for installation and their priority for installation.
      A typical example for an order file is given here:
    </para>
    <screen>
# yast/order: priority of installation sources
#
# source-       product
# description   path
/yast/sles8     /sles8-i386/CD1
/yast/ul        /unitedlinux-i386/CD1
/               /
    </screen>

    <para> 
      The order file is ASCII, line based, '#' at the beginning of a
      line denote a comment line.
    </para>    
    <para> 
      Each non-comment line should contain two (tab separated)
      directory specifications. If the second one is omitted, it defaults to
      "/".
    </para>
    <para> 
      The first directory specifies the location of the description.
      The second directory specifies the location of the product as defined here.
      For CD/DVD bases products, this is usually "/". But for network installations,
      or if several product are placed on a single CD, each product needs a
      separate path.
    </para>
    <para>
      You can even specify a full URL (e.g. "nfs://my-nfs-server.domain.org/product/CD1") in the second column. 
      During installation, you can't switch the type of media. If your
      installer source is CD, every other source must be CD based. If your
      installer source is NFS, every other source is expected to be on the
      same NFS server.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the above example of the order file, note the last line being
      "/". This means the last of the three installation sources is on the
      same media as the installer.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section>
    <title>
      The instorder file
    </title>
    <para>
      As stated above, the <filename>/yast/order</filename> file lists the sources in priority
      order. So a package from a source listed earlier in this file
      overrides a package (of the same name) from a later source. This
      technique is used to override the yast2-translation packages from
      unitedlinux-i386 (where all help texts refer to UnitedLinux) with
      yast2-translation packages from sles8-i386 (where all help texts
      refer to SuSE Linux).
    </para>
    <para>
      
      But the <filename>/yast/order</filename> also defines the installation
      order, which might not be wanted when the 'base' packages are on a
      lower-priority source.
    </para>
    <para>
      This is where <filename>/yast/instorder</filename> comes into play. This defines the installation
      order by repeating the entries of the first column of <filename>/yast/order</filename> in
      the right order.
    </para>

    

    <para>
      A typical example for an instorder file is given here:
    </para>
    <screen>
# yast/instorder: order of installation sources
#
# install 'ul' before 'sles8'
#
/yast/ul
/yast/sles8
/
    </screen>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section>

    <title>Setting it all up</title>

    <para> 
      Combining multiple sources requires that all sources comply to
      the UnitedLinux media description standard.
    </para>
    <para>
      In the source directory, copy all SLES and UL into separate directories
      (CDs can also be copied into one single directory, but to keep a clean
      structure, CDs can be copied into separate directories, i.e. using the
      following scheme: UL/CD1, UL/CD2, UL/CD3 and SLES8.)
    </para>    
    <para>
      Upon boot, Linuxrc requires the presence of the boot directory (which
      contains the <filename>root</filename> file), the
      <filename>media.N</filename> directory and the
      <filename>content</filename> file. Having those files in the root of the
      source will insure that linuxrc can start the YaST installer.
    </para>
    <para>Once YaST has started, it will search the root of source for
      installation files using values from the <filename>content</filename>
      file name. However, to detect if multiple sources are involved, YaST
      first search for the
      <filename>order</filename> and <filename>instorder</filename> in the
      <filename>yast</filename> directory. The files in the  <filename>yast</filename> directory
      will reroute YaST and direct it to search for the installation files and
      media description in different locations than root of the source.
    </para>
    <para>
      On the installer source create a <filename>yast/order</filename> as described above
      and enter the location of the description data and
      packages. Alternatively, you can copy the description data of all sources to separate
      directories in the <filename>yast</filename> directory (This is the case
      on the SLES CD which contains the description data for UL to support
      multiple sources using CDs).
    </para>
    <para>
      In the 'order' example above, the 'order' directory structure
      looks as follows: 
    </para>
    <screen>
yast/
  instorder                     # instorder file 
  order                         # order file

    </screen>
    <para>
      YaST now takes this description instead of the one from the
      <emphasis>real</emphasis> media for the installation.      
      So when asking for a specific media, this media must match the
      <filename>media.1/media</filename>  file from the
      <emphasis>order</emphasis> directory.
      
    </para>
    <para>
      All dependencies (package or selection) are fulfilled by looking at
      all installation sources. If multiple sources provide a dependency,
      the source listed first in the 'order' file wins. (The installation
      order equals the installation priority currently).

    <title>Example using SLES 8 and UnitedLinux 1.0 CDs</title>

      On the NFS server, create a directory which will serve as the
      installation source and make sure it is exported via NFS. This
      directory will be used later to specify the installation source using
      <command>linuxrc</command>.

      The following script illustrates what directories need to be created
      and where you should copy the data from the CDs. In this script, it
      is assumed that you have ISO images. In most cases you will have
      CDROMs instead. Do not use this script as provided. If you wish to

	The file <filename>order</filename> will determine the priority for
	the packages to be installed. The service pack should have the highest
	priority as it holds all updated packages. It also should appear before
	the SLES source because it holds updated SLES packages.

      <title>SP3 Auto-installation directly from SP CD image</title>
      <para>
	Another alternative to adding SP3 as an additional source exists. This
	requires executing a script at the end of the installation which mounts
	a remote file system containing the image of the SP3 CD and calling the
	update scripts available on the SP CD or calling any other script to
	update the packages.
      </para>
      <para>Such a script can be called in the post-install phase, and can
	consist of the following steps:</para>
      <itemizedlist>

	  <para>Mount the remote file system</para>
	</listitem>

	  <para>Call one of the scripts available on the SP CD,
	    i.e. <filename>install_update_rpms.sh</filename>

	<listitem>
	  <para>Schedule the system for reboot after the installation and

	  When installing using this method, the online update, YOU, will fail
	  to report the right product. YOU reads the product data from the
	  directory <filename>/var/adm/YaST/ProdDB</filename> and takes the
	  last product description file available in the directory if multiple
	  sources were used to install the system.	  
	</para>
	<para>
	  If the system is being auto-installed, the order of the product files
	  can be changed using  a post-install script, otherwise they have to
	  be changed manually.
