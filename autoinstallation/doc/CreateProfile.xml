    <title>Collect information</title>
    <para>
      In order to create the control file, first you need to collect
      information about the systems your are going to
      install. This includes among other things hardware data and network
      information. Make sure you know the following about the machines you want to install:
    </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
	<para>Hard disk types and sizes</para>	  
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Graphic interface and attached monitor if any</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
	<para>Network interface and MAC address if known (i.e. when using &dhcp;)</para>
      </listitem>	
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>
      With these parameters you are ready to go and create a profile of your systems
      to control the auto-installation process.

      Using the Configuration Management System
    </title>  
    <para>
      In order to create the control file for one or more computers, a configuration
      interface based on &yast2; is provided. This system depends on existing modules
      which are usually used to configure a computer in regular operation mode,
      i.e. after &company-suse; Linux is installed.
    </para>
    <para>
      The configuration management system lets you create control files easily and
      additionally it lets you manage a repository of configurations for use
      in a networked environment and with multiple clients.

      <para>
	With some exceptions, almost all resources of the control file can
	be configured using the configuration management system. The system
	offers flexibility and  configuration of some resources is
	identical to this  available in the &yast2; Control Center. In
	addition to the existing and familiar modules new
	interfaces were created for special and complex configurations,
	for example for  partitioning, general options and software.	  
      </para>
      <para>
	Furthermore, using the &cms; guarantees that the resulting control file is
	valid and insures that it can be used directly to start  automated installation.
      </para>
      <para>
	Make sure the configuration system is installed (package
	<emphasis>autoyast2</emphasis>) and call it using the <emphasis>YaST2
	  Control  Center</emphasis> or call it directly as root with the
	following command (make sure the <emphasis>DISPLAY</emphasis> variable is set correctly to
	start the graphical user interface instead of the text based one):

      <title>Import of Legacy and Foreign Configuration Files</title>

      <para>
	&autoyast2; offers the option  to  import <abbrev>ALICE</abbrev> configuration files from
	previous SuSE releases and foreign auto-installation systems
	(Kickstart). Consult the chapter dealing with these issues in this
	manual.

    <title>Creating/Editing a Control File Manually</title>
    <para>
      If you edit the control file manually, make sure it  has a valid syntax. To
      check the syntax, use some tools already available
      on the distribution. For example to verify that the file is well
      formed, use the utility <command>xmllint</command> available with the
      <emphasis>libxml2</emphasis> package:     
    </para>
    <screen>
xmllint &lt;control file&gt;
    </screen>
    <para>
      If the control file is not well formed, i.e. if a tag is not closed,
      <command>xmllint</command> will report about the errors.
    </para>    
    <para>
      Before going on with the auto-installation, please fix any errors
      resulting from such checks. The auto-installation process can't be
      started with  an invalid and non-well formed control file.
    </para>

    <para>
      You can use any XML editor  available on your system or use your
      favorite text editor with XML support (i.e. Emacs, Vim). However, it is not quite
      optimal to create the control file manually for large number of machines
      and it should only be seen as an interface between the auto-installation
      engine and the Configuration Management System (<abbrev>CMS</abbrev>).
