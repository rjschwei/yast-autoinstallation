Rules
------

When a client boots in auto-installation mode the way the installation goes on depends on 2 factors:
1. Control file to be used is given
2. No specific control file is supplied

In the first case the file is retrieved and the system gets more instruction from the retrieved control file.

In the second case, the client probes for system identifiers and charachteristics to determine which files it 
should download from the profile server.

The client goes through  a set of default rules trying to find it's control file on the profile server. In any case, 
a default control file should be created to server clients globaly. If no control files can be found, the installation 
aborts with an error.
