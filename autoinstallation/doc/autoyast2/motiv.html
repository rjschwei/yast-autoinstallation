	  A standard Linux installation asks many questions about what to
	  install, what hardware to configure, how to configure the network
	  interface, etc. Answering these questions once is informative and maybe
	  even fun. But imagine a system engineer who has to set up a new Linux
	  network with a large number of machines. Now, the same issues need to
	  be addressed and the same questions answered repeatedly. This makes the
	  task very inefficient, not to mention a source of irritation and
	  boredom. Hence, a need arises to automate this parameter and option
	  selection."</SPAN

>"The thought of simply copying the hard disks naturally crosses one's
	  mind. This can be done quickly, and all the necessary functions and
	  software will be copied without option selection. However, the fact is
	  that simple copying of hard disks causes the individual computers to
	  become too similar. This, in turn, creates an altogether new mission of
	  having to reconfigure the individual settings on each PC. For example,
	  IP addresses for each machine will have to be reset. If this is not
	  done properly, strange and inexplicable behavior results."</SPAN

>&#13;	Regular installation of SuSE Linux is semi-automated by default. The user is
	requested to select the necessary information at the beginning of the
	installation (In most cases language only) and <ACRONYM
CLASS="acronym"
>YaST2</ACRONYM
>  generates a
	proposal for the underlying system depending on different factors. In
	most cases, and especially for new systems, such a proposal needs not
	to be changed and can be used to install the system and provides a
	usable installation.
      </P

	prompted at the end of the installation to provide more information
